## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### 1. User Information Form (Step 1)
**Purpose:** Collect user details for personalization
**Components:**
- Form with name, job title, company, email fields
- Form validation using React Hook Form
- Professional styling with Shadcn/UI components

**Data Flow:** Form data → UserInfo context → Header display

### 2. File Upload (Step 2)
**Purpose:** CSV file upload and validation
**Features:**
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- CSV validation (22 required columns)
- Real-time file preview (first 5 rows)
- Error handling and user feedback

**Required CSV Columns:**
```
order id, order date, ship date, ship mode, customer id, 
customer name, segment, country, city, state, postal code, 
region, product id, category, sub-category, product name, 
sales, quantity, discount, profit, days to ship, rating
```

**Data Processing:** CSV file → PapaParse → Raw data validation → Analytics processing

### 3. Analytics Dashboard (Step 3)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive business intelligence dashboard

#### Overview Tab
**KPI Cards (6 metrics):**
- Total Revenue: Sum of all sales with YoY growth
- Total Profit: Sum of all profit with YoY growth  
- Total Orders: Count of unique orders with YoY growth
- Total Customers: Count of unique customers with YoY growth
- Profit Ratio: (Total Profit / Total Sales) * 100
- AOV (Average Order Value): Total Sales / Total Orders

**Visualizations:**
- Performance Over Time: Line chart showing monthly sales/profit trends
- Category Revenue: Pie chart with percentage labels
- Segment Revenue: Pie chart (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
- Region Revenue: Bar chart by geographic region
- Ship Mode Revenue: Bar chart by shipping method
- Customer Reviews: Bar chart showing rating distribution

#### Regional Tab
**Geographic Analysis:**

- Color coding: Red (losses) → Yellow (low profit) → Green (high profit)
- Regional Customer Growth: Stacked bar chart by year and region
- Regional Sales by Years: Stacked bar chart showing sales trends

#### Customer Tab
**Customer Intelligence:**

- Profit by Sub-category: Bar chart with loss highlighting (red bars)
- Product Profit Analysis Table: Detailed product performance metrics

### 4. Product Recommendations (Step 4)
**Purpose:** AI-powered product suggestions

**Algorithm Logic:**
1. Customer segmentation by segment and region
2. Find similar customers in same segment/region
3. Identify popular products among similar customers
4. Calculate popularity scores and average sales
5. Return top recommendations excluding already purchased items

**Components:**
- Customer selector dropdown
- Customer profile display with spending metrics
- Recommendation cards with product details
- Popularity scoring and visual indicators

## Data Processing Logic

### Analytics Calculations

```typescript
// Core metrics calculation
totalSales = sum(sales for all records)
totalProfit = sum(profit for all records)
totalOrders = count(unique order_id)
uniqueCustomers = count(unique customer_id)
profitRatio = (totalProfit / totalSales) * 100
avgOrderValue = totalSales / totalOrders
```

### Aggregations
- **Monthly Trends:** Group by year-month, sum sales/profit
- **Category Analysis:** Group by category, sum sales/profit
- **Regional Analysis:** Group by region, calculate totals
- **Customer Analysis:** Group by customer, calculate lifetime value

### Data Validation
- Ensures all 22 required columns are present
- Validates numeric fields (sales, profit, quantity)
- Checks date formats (order_date, ship_date)
- Verifies data completeness

## Filtering & Interactivity

### Dashboard Filters
- **Region Filter:** Filter all visualizations by geographic region
- **Category Filter:** Filter by product category
- **Date Range:** Implicit filtering by available data range

### Interactive Elements
- **Tab Navigation:** Switch between Overview, Regional, Customer, Orders, Product
- **Table Sorting:** Sort tables by various columns
- **Chart Tooltips:** Hover interactions showing detailed data
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes

### State Synchronization
- Filters update multiple visualizations simultaneously
- Context API ensures consistent state across components
- Loading states provide user feedback during data processing

## Custom Design Choices

### Visual Design System
- **Color Palette:** 
  - Primary Blue: #3B82F6 (analytics-blue)
  - Success Green: #10B981 (analytics-green)
  - Warning Orange: #F59E0B
  - Error Red: #EF4444
  - Purple: #8B5CF6

### Typography
- **Font:** Inter (Google Fonts) - Professional and readable
- **Hierarchy:** Clear heading structure with consistent sizing

### Custom Components
- **Star Ratings:** 5-star rating display for products/orders
- **Profit Highlighting:** Red text for negative profits
- **Gradient Backgrounds:** Professional gradient backgrounds for headers
- **Animation System:** Smooth fade-in and scale-in animations

### Responsive Design
- **Grid Layouts:** Responsive grid systems for different screen sizes
- **Mobile Optimization:** Touch-friendly interfaces and appropriate sizing
- **Flexible Charts:** Charts adapt to container sizes

## Performance Optimizations

### Data Processing
- **Memoization:** Expensive calculations cached using useMemo
- **Lazy Loading:** Components loaded only when needed
- **Efficient Aggregations:** Single-pass data processing where possible

### React Optimizations
- **Context Optimization:** Separate contexts for different data types
- **Component Splitting:** Large components broken into smaller pieces
- **Virtual Scrolling:** For large data tables (implemented via libraries)

### Bundle Optimization
- **Tree Shaking:** Only imported icons and components included
- **Code Splitting:** Route-based code splitting with React Router
- **Asset Optimization:** Optimized imports and bundle analysis

## Error Handling

### File Upload Errors
- Invalid file format detection
- File size limitations (50MB)
- Missing column validation
- Data format validation

### Data Processing Errors
- Graceful handling of malformed data
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback states for missing data

### Runtime Error Handling
- React Error Boundaries (implicit through libraries)
